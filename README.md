# ðŸŒ™ Go Beyond .. NYC-StargazersðŸŒ™


Ever wanted to check out today's photo of the day? Well now you can! This application allows the user to view the day's Picture Of the Day from NASA! The photo comes with a detailed description, along with the official title of the photo. As an addition, if the user so chooses, they're able to choose a prior date and view the photo with its evaluation for that day. The photo may instead be a video, depending on the day.

### How It's Made:
#### Tech Used: HTML / CSS / Javascript

I used HTML and CSS for styling and semantic content. For the Javascript I fetched a Promise from the NASA API. I converted the data to JSON, and used event listeners to add functionality to the application. While digging through the API data, I noticed not every image is necesariliy a photo. So I utilized a conditional statement in my javascript, along with an optional <iframe> tag in my HTML, to account for the posibility the user chooses a day that includes a video.
  

  ### Lessons Learned:
  
  When learning a new language or skill, it may seem manageable while just learning syntax and definitions. The real development comes from building, and I must say this is my favorite way to apply what I've learned. I learned about the Promise object in Javascript, and I learned how different API's can produce data in different ways. Learning how to navigate through all of it was a special treat. Enjoy!
